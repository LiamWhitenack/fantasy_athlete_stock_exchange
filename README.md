# Fantasy-Athlete-Stock-Exchange
FASE combines the excitement of fantasy sports with the dynamics of stock trading, allowing users to invest in virtual athlete stocks for free.


FASE has 3 essential functions:

**1. Predicting the career earnings of a player: The estimated career earnings of a player will determine the market cap of an athlete. When a player retires or a season ends without the athlete on a roster the athlete's stock will be distributed to owners based on the investor's stake.**


Potential roadblocks include:
  * A lack of real time, accurate data on athletes' salary, injury, statistics, and retirement status.
  * The unpredictability of sports leading to an inability to predict player salary, especially for young or soon-to-be professionals.


Potential Solutions include:
  * Web scraping or Kaggle player data.
  * Augmented predictions in addition to possible reddit/twitter sentiment analysis.


**2. Reacting in real time (kind of) to user's willingness/unwillingness to buy stock by adjusting stock price and buying and selling stock based on the current price.**

Potential roadblocks include:
  * If a player tears his ACL or has some other major injury, players should not be able to sell stock back to the shareholder for the current estimated price since the algorithm will not be able to react quickly enough to the incoming news to know that the player's value has been negatively affected.
  * There may be a lack of investing knowledge between all of the people working on the project.
  * The ever-increasing salary cap of certain sports leagues compared with the stagnant/declining growth of other leagues.


Potential solutions include:
  * Closing the FASE from 9:30 to 4:00 like the real stock market.
  * Keeping the brokers from buying too much stock at one time/rewarding the people to buy/sell stock the fastest after news.
  * Plenty of research on how the stock market works.


**3. Allowing users to place bids on and auction stock as well as borrow shares (with interest) with the intention of shorting them**
Potential roadblocks include:
  * Not having enough users to be able to sell stock to anyone but the computer.


Potential solutions include:
  * ~150 bots that act somewhat randomly but not erratically.
  * Making the brokers very accomodating.


**4. Storing user and athlete data in a database without ever starting over**
Potential roadblocks include:
  * Where would we store the data?
  * Lack of experience.
  * Lagggggggg from using cheap/free storage <- probably will never be a problem due to low traffic.


Potential solutions include:
  * figuring this out later.



## Ways to make the app fun:
* Giving players a large bonus for making an account (~50k)
* Being able to make clans/leagues to compete against friends you know.
* Having a (local/league-based/worldwide) leaderboard of the richest/fastest growing users
* Parodying the native "Stocks" iOS app.
* Giving a player a salary when they log into the app each day (with holiday/big sporting event bonuses).

## Why I (hopefully we) want to build this app
* This will let me practie ML, Dart/Flutter UI building, db management, real time server updates, and potentially web scraping.
* This will give me a way to plug into sports even more and hold my own takes on player's futures accountable.
* This will give me a chance to work with Micah Wehrle (and hopefully more) on a project.
* This will give me a nice springboard into investing

## Why YOU should use the app when it's done
* This is a way to augment sports consumption
* This is a way to learn more about investing without any risk
